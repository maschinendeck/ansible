           # This plug can be used to train via an arbitrary program that
           # receives the message on standard input. Since sendmail can be
           # such a program, it can be used to send the message to another
           # email address for training there.
           #
           # For example:
           #   antispam_pipe_program = /path/to/mailtrain

           # antispam_mail_spam, antispam_mail_notspam and antispam_mail_tmpdir.
